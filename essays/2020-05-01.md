Today is labor day and I have had the free time to start writing an actual post. Instead of doing regular labor, I decided to do labor I actually love. ^_*

Most of the countries of the world is in lockdown due to COVID-19, and Singapore is no different. We are in a 'circuit breaker' period, where people try to stay at home as much as they can to try and flatten the curve and 'break' the chain of transmissions.

As such, I had been working from home for almost a month now. It doesn't actually make work easier though. I actually spend more time doing work at home. People can no longer differentiate the boundaries of when actual work starts and ends, so it's getting a little bit harder dealing with people from different timezones.

I also found the time to finally at least have a decent working release of my open source project, [YAPV](https://mycql.github.io/yapv). I actually started this project a while back 2017, with very little actual code. I tried to find time to re-start it the first quarter of this year.

The past few years had been very busy. Being a senior staff engineer, it has been really challenging trying to balance my time between leading teams, managing projects and stakeholders, dealing with organization politics and mentoring juniors. All that on top of my actual engineering duties of designing system architecture and shipping production code for our commerce and science platforms.

So it feels really good to be able go back to writing software on my free time which is my real passion. I like dealing with code more than dealing with people. :)
